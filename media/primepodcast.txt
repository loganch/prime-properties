Hey! It's Episode 1,247 of the Prime Properties podcast.

Today we'll talk about staging your house for a quick sale.

Here are some tips:
Remove clutter.
Remove personal photos.
Clean out closets and even drawers — those buyers look everywhere!
Also, take a close look at your furniture — less furniture can make a room look larger.

Rent a storage area and move in your clutter and extra furniture.
Then get ready for a quick offer and a move to your new home.
That's all for now!
